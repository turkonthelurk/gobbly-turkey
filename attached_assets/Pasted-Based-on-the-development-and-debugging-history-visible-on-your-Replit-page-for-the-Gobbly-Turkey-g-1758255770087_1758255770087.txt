Based on the development and debugging history visible on your Replit page for the "Gobbly Turkey" game, the issue is likely recurring around the handoff from Level 1 to Level 2. When the game freezes or fails to progress, it usually points to a problem with state management or the logic that handles the level transition.

Hereâ€™s what you should check, drawing from the previous fixes and common failure points in web games:

### 1. **Check the Browser's Developer Console**
This is the most critical first step. The moment the game freezes, check the browser's developer console for any red error messages. An error here will often point directly to the function or variable that caused the crash.

### 2. **Verify the Level-Up Trigger Logic**
The game is supposed to transition to Level 2 after 10 points. You need to ensure this logic is firing correctly and only once.
* **Is the condition being met?** Use `console.log` to track the score and confirm that the `if (score >= 10)` (or similar) condition is being triggered.
* **Is the level-up function being called?** Inside that `if` block, make sure the function to start the next level (`startLevel2()`, `setLevel(2)`, etc.) is actually being called.

### 3. **Inspect the Game State Reset**
A freeze often happens when the game tries to start a new level without properly cleaning up the old one. The function that starts Level 2 should be doing the following:
* **Clearing existing obstacles:** Are all the pipes or barriers from Level 1 being removed from the game world and any related arrays? If not, the game might freeze trying to process non-existent objects.
* **Applying Level 2 difficulty settings:** The log mentioned new settings for `SPEED`, `SPAWN_MS`, and `GAP`. Confirm that these new variables are being correctly loaded and applied to the game engine. A freeze could occur if a variable is set to an invalid value (e.g., `0`) that causes a division-by-zero error in the game loop.
* **Resetting the player state:** Does the turkey's position or velocity need to be reset to a starting point for the new level?

### 4. **Confirm State Synchronization**
The previous logs highlight a key problem: **synchronizing the React state with the game engine state**.
* When the level-up is triggered, the React UI needs to update to show "Level: 2".
* Simultaneously, the main game loop (likely running on the HTML canvas) must be notified that the level has changed so it can use the new difficulty parameters.
* A failure in this communication is a likely cause. The UI might be trying to run Level 2 while the game engine is stuck with Level 1 data, causing a crash. Review how the React component communicates with the game's core logic.
